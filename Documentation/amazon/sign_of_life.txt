ign_of_life driver

1. Overview:

  sign_of_life driver provides the "life cycle reason" of Amazon device to
userland application via /proc/life_cycle_reason. "life of reason" means why
device got powered off or rebooted or booted. For example, device may
get shutdown by thermal service due to an overheated CPU. During next booting,
the sign_of_life driver will find out the thermal shutdown reason and provides
the reason to the /proc interface. Then userland application will read
the /proc/life_cycle_reason and reports this abnormal event to device health
servers.

2. Interfaces for kernel:

Following four kernel APIs are exported for other kernel components:

int life_cycle_set_boot_reason(life_cycle_reason_t boot_reason);
-This function will set the boot reason which causing device booting,
 such as: kernel panics, normal reboot, power key turn on device etc.
-Return 0 on success, -1 on failure.

int life_cycle_set_shutdown_reason(life_cycle_reason_t shutdown_reason);
-This function will set the shutdown reason which causing device shutdown.
 such as: normal software shutdown, sudden power loss off and long press
 powerkey off etc.
-Return 0 on success, -1 on failure.


int life_cycle_set_thermal_shutdown_reason(life_cycle_reason_t thermal_shutdown_reason);
-This function will set the Thermal Shutdown reason which causing device
 shutdown, such as: overheated cpus, overheated wifi, overheated PCB, overheated
 PMIC etc.
-Return 0 on success, -1 on failure.


int life_cycle_set_special_mode(life_cycle_reason_t life_cycle_special_mode);
-This function will set the special mode which causing device life cycle change,
 such as: OTA mode, factory reset mode, low battery mode etc.
-Return 0 on success, -1 on failure.

3. Interfaces for userspace:
A /proc/life_of_reason will be added. It will provides driver version, life cycle
reason and life cycle type(normal or abnormal). For example, if device was rebooted
due to a kernel panic, the output from /proc interface will be as following:

cat /proc/life_cycle_reason
lc_version:2.0
lc_reason:Warm Boot By Kernel Panic
lc_type:LCR_abnormal
